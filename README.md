Mouse Strain SNP Counter
A Streamlit app for exploring genetic variants (SNPs) in mouse strains, focused on gene regions and candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs).

Features
Gene or Region Lookup: Search by gene symbol or genomic coordinates.
Strain Selection: Choose from common founder strains or any strain in the VCF.
SNP Counting: Get counts of homozygous and heterozygous SNPs for your selected region and strain.
Variant Consequences: View and download the distribution of variant consequences (from VCF annotations).
cCRE Overlap: See which variants overlap with candidate cis-regulatory elements.
Download Results: Export tables as CSV for downstream analysis.
